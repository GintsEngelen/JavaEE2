# JavaEE2

This was the second assignment of a Distributed Systems course. We were tasked with developing a Distributed Car Rental application. In this project, we used Java Beans and the JDBC API to communicate with a MySQL database.

All code was the result of pair-programming sessions between myself and Brecht Philtjens.
